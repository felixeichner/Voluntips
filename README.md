# voluntips.herokuapp.com

This is the ruby code to the website __[voluntips.herokuapp.com](https://voluntips.herokuapp.com)__


## Purpose of the website

Voluntips introduces the reader to several environmental protection projects to volunteer at. It is written in German and aiming at german readers.

This project is written in __Rails 5.1.4__ and __Ruby 2.4.1__. It is my first own Rails project and I use it to experiment and gain more experience.


## Structure

The website is divided into two main sections, the projects overview and details on the one hand, texts on volunteering and what to consider when volunteering on the other.

The volunteering section is a simple bootstrap 4 nav tab view of different articles.

In the projects section there's an overview and two levels of filters. You can search for projects by clicking just one bottom to focus on a certain group of animals projects deal with. The second level filter is a form giving the opportunity to select several different filter attributes.

Logged in as an admin there are more features to edit the projects and articles.
